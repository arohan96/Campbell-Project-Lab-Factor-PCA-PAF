The code that is in this section is the version of the simulated data analysis code which was used to get the results and analysis that were in the presentation on Thursday, December 12, 2024. By downloading the eight files in this branch and running ConfidenceMakerByFactor, a confidence interval like those seen in the presentation can be made. The 'plots' folder also includes pregenerated confidence intervals (made by looping this code) with a specified naming scheme which identifies the amount of idiosyncratic volatility used in the test (as a percentage), the number of assets (nMkts) used in the test, and the number of factors used in the test.
